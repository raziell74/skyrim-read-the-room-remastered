# Known Bugs

Bugs that either I've encountered or were reported in "Bugs" tab of the original mod.

## Looking Into

- [ ] Equip/Unequip helmet while in beast form breaks the character
- [ ] Some Vanilla/DLC Masks and Hoods break RTR
- [ ] Wooden Mask (Labyrithian) Auto equips when leaving the mask realm
  - Pretty sure the Remaster fixes this but I haven't tested it yet
- [ ] Undeletable
  - This issue is being addressed in a future plans feature
- [ ] CC Content helmets and hats don't work
- [ ] Some Vanilla/DLC Hoods aren't lowered and instead are treated like helmets
- [ ] Function 'Require Armor for Hip Placement' is bugged
- [ ] Immersive Armors Helmets don't work
- [ ] Circlets are still treated as Helmets even if "Manage Circlets like Helmets" is disabled in the MCM
  - I think the Remaster fixes this but I need to test
