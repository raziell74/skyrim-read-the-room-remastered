# Known Bugs - Currently Looking Into

These are bugs that either I've encountered or were reported in "Bugs" tab of the original mod.
Check the Change Log for a list of bugs that have been squashed so far!

- [ ] Wooden Mask (Labyrithian) Auto equips when leaving the mask realm
- [ ] Cannot remove ReadTheRoom
  - This issue is being addressed in the "Uninstall Button" feature outlined in the "future plans" section.
- [ ] CC Content helmets and hats don't work
- [ ] Immersive Armors Helmets don't work

# Remastered Version

- [ ] Lowerable hoods have a brief fully unequiped state when unequipping after a Combat Equip. The hood is removed without a lowered hood added and then the animation plays a tiny bit of time after that. It's not ... game breaking, but it does break the immersion.
- [ ] Most Recent RTR action will lose it's state when quitting the game and reloading a save. This causes followers and the player to not correctly equip/unequip head wear when changing cells / locations if the equip state was changed using the toggle key or manually in the inventory.
- [ ] Taking/Adding items to followers in the Follower Trade menu is laggy becaues of the follower OnEquip/Unequip Event scripts.
